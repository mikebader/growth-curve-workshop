# Course Description

Epidemiological studies often require modeling how outcomes or risks change over time. This class provides an introduction to models that can be used to analyze that change. The course will introduce students to the basics of latent growth analysis and how to model random intercept, random slope, and random intercept and slope models. The course will focus on the connection between standard regression models and the generalized mixed models used to model patterns of growth. We will discuss the basic model, how to measure time to analyze different types of change, and show how to set up and analyze data. Simple simulations and analysis examples will be conducted in R. 

# Prerequisites

Experience with data management will be beneficial but not required.


# Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, participants will be able to:
1.  Write models describing random slope, random intercept, and random intercept and slope models
2.  Interpret results all three models
3.  Identify the proper modeling technique for analytical questions regarding change
4.  Analyse a basic longitudinal model in R
