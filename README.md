# Growth Curve Modeling

This page contains information for the [epi@summer program][epic] course on [growth curve modeling][gmm] taught by [Michael Bader][mdmb].

## Code Files
Code for all of the simulations and analysis examples can be found in the `R/` directory in this repository. 

The course demonstrates the principles of growth modeling using simulations and analysis from [Zillow][] that had been previously publicly available (unfortunately Zillow has stopped distributing the data). 

[Zillow]: http://www.zillow.com/

### Downloading R & RStudio
To follow along in the course, you should download both [R][] and RStudio before attending the class. 

[R]: https://ctan.r-project.org/
[RStudio]: https://www.rstudio.com/

To download R, visit: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html and pick the mirror you would like to use to download the package for your operating system (it doesn't matter which one, they all serve the same files, but generally ones geographically closer to you will be faster)

**After** you have downloaded and installed R on your machine, you should download and install RStudio. To do so visit: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and download RStudio Desktop (the free one!)

Install both according to your operating system.

### Obtaining the Course Files

To get the files for the course, you may click on the green button that says "Clone or Download" at the top of this page to download a zipped package containing the files in the repository. Unpack the files into a directory on your computer that will be easy to access. Alternatively, you may type the following into a Terminal session (if you don't know what that is, use the button above): 

	git clone https://github.com/mikebader/growth-curve-workshop
